                <h3>The History of Walkden and Little Hulton's Tea with Santa</h3>
                <p>Back in the summer of 2021, the idea of Tea with Santa was born when the now Tea with Santa Team (who were members of the congregation at St. John the Baptist Church) proposed to run a secular Christmas event that aimed to build community and bring together people after the difficult years of separation that the COVID pandemic caused. Our one and primary goal was to build a community and to spread Christmas cheer. Across 3 events in December last year, we welcomed more than 70 children to sit down, have a meal and meet Santa. We were met with tremendous success, which prompted us to run the event again, this year!</p>
                <p>Our Tea with Santa event is the culmination of months of hard work from people aging from 16 to 80, all working as volunteers to make this the best event possible. From our inception to the present, the Tea with Santa team works closely with those at St John's church, whilst remianing strictly secular and open to people of all backgrounds and faiths. To show our thanks to those at St. John's church, from the small amount of money the event makes, we make a donation to them, which they will use in the renovation of their church buildings, however, the bulk of all money raised is used to fund future events, may it be Tea With Santa 2023, or some new idea!</p>
                <p>The Tea with Santa team is committed to continuing to build community outside of the holiday period too. Throughout the year, we help to run other events, in 2022 we were involved in the Scarecrow Festival (October 2022) and the Easter Fun-day (April 2022) that took place in Walkden. We are excited to continue our story in 2022 and lookforward to all that is planned in 2023!!</p>
