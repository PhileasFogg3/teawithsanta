            <h3>Welcome to Tea With Santa 2022</h3>
            <p>Tea With Santa is community event for families to come together and share the excitement of Santa's impending visit. The Big Man himself will be in attendance (along with some of his helpers) and will spend time with all of the children, both with individual families and as a group during a shared meal. Many children participate in Christmas parties, either at school or other organisation, but parents are seldom present to witness the excitement first-hand; this is what makes our event different. Please have a look around the site to find out more, but if you are interested in attending with your family, we recommend booking early as spaces are strictly limited.</p>
